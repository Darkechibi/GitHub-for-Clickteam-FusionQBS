// the player sits centered of the screen wiht a left to right rotating cannon the emits a "laser" each thing destroyed creates a chain reaction explosion, on the ground are targets (cities obstinsevly) that can be destroyed by enemy fire  that targets the "cities", they must not be destroyed or its game over (8 cities)... the player has a heat and and cannot fire if over heated, other resources and limitations for movemnt and alternative fire exist,
// First is a missile "bomb" which creates an explosion  that has large destruction. A tracking missile (devving) that goes to the nearest enemy. and the ability to move in short hops to redeploy a  positioning of the beam.
// 
// the enemy "flies overhead" from the left or right of the screen at semi variable speeds and they "target" the cities... much of it pure random... the game goes until a wave ends or the cities have all been elimated. enemy shots come in from above, these photon shot are minor damage but onstant harrass.

	// Each time a star is created, we subtract 1 from the Star Counter, because if we don't the event will keep looping.

	// We also make the stars invisible so the user will not have a siezure while
	// looking at all the stars being created.
	// 
	// Our screen is 640 X 480 so we want the stars to be set inside these
